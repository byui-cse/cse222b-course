      <h1>The Why of Kotlin</h1>
      <h3>Some Background</h3>
      <p>
        All languages have a few needs in common. They should to be safe to
        write (reducing crashes and hacking), fast, and expressive. Not all
        languages achieve all these needs. Sometimes this is due to the age of
        the language. C and C++ are examples of this. Neither of these languages
        are particularly designed to be safe. Safty wasn't an issue when they
        were initially created. For C, networks of distinct, connected computers
        did not exist outside of labs where networking was being studied. For
        C++, networks were brand new and not well understood. This meant that,
        when these languages were created, there was no thought about someone
        'hacking into' your computer remotely. Therefore, no care was taken to
        reduce this possibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might think that Kotlin was created only for Android devices, but
        that wasn't and isn't
        <a href="https://Kotlin.org/about/" target="_blank">the stated goal</a>
        of the creators and developers of Kotlin. What they wanted to create was
        a general purpose language that could span everything from watches to
        huge servers. They also wanted to make the language safe to use, fast,
        and have an expressive syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        To meet these requirements, they pulled concepts from many different
        languages. It may be surprising to some, but Java, the language that
        supplied the virtual machine on which Kotlin runs, provided none to
        little of the syntax for Kotlin. Instead, languages such as Haskell and
        SML have had much more of an impact on Kotlin's syntax. So much so, that
        Android's new library for creating user interfaces is
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"
          target="_blank"
          >declarative</a
        >, not object oriented. This class doesn't cover anything Android
        specific. If you want to know that library, you can study it on your own
        or take the mobile development course after completing this and the
        Swift language course.
      </p>
      <h3>Python 3 and Kotlin are Cousins</h3>
      <p>
        Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestry of both Kotlin and
        Python. Since an earlier version of C is an ancestor of of both C and
        Kotlin you can expect to see some things in Kotlin that remind you of
        what you learned regarding coding when you used Python. A very strong
        contributor to Kotlin is the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)"
          target="_blank"
          >Haskell language</a
        >. Because of this ancestry, Kotlin has a much stronger
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"
          target="_blank"
          >functional programming</a
        >
        foundation than Python and many other languages do.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you learn Kotlin and if you become familiar with its ancestral
        languages, you will be able to pick out of the syntax and behavior
        influences of its ancestors.

      <h1>Installations</h1>
      <h3>The IDE</h3>
      <p>
        Regardless of the OS you are developing on, the Integrated Development
        Environment (IDE) selected for this course is
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>. This IDE was
        selected because the same company that created Kotlin created this IDE.
        Go to the
        <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ</a>
        and download the installer the Community Edition that matches your
        operating system. When you start IntelliJ you will be presented with a
        screen that allows you to create a new project.
      </p>
      <h1>Workflow</h1>
      <p>
        The work you do using this IDE will flow like this. Each time you are
        asked to do a task, you will create a project named for the task. For
        example, if you were asked for your task to write code that calculated
        loan payments, you could create a project called loan_pay_calc.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will reduce your
        workload. Do not create a single project that holds all of your tasks.
        You will deeply regret that choice by the end of the class.
