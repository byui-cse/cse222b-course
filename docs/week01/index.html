	<h2>The Why of Kotlin</h2>
	<h3>Some Background</h3>
	<p>
		All languages have a few needs in common. They should to be safe to write (reducing crashes and hacking), fast, and expressive.
		Not all languages achieve all these needs. Sometimes this is due to the age of the language. C and C++ are examples of this. 
		Neither of these languages are particularly designed to be safe. Safty wasn't an issue when they were initially created. For C, 
		networks of distinct, connected computers did not exist outside of labs where networking was being studied. For C++, networks were 
		brand new and not well understood. This meant that, when these languages were created, there was no thought about someone 'hacking into' 
		your computer remotely. Therefore, no care was taken to reduce this possibility.
	</p>
	<p>
		Some might think that Kotlin was created only for Android devices, but that wasn't and isn't 
		<a href="https://Kotlin.org/about/"  target="_blank">the stated goal</a> 
		of the creators and developers of Kotlin. What they wanted to create was a general purpose language that could span everything from watches to 
		huge servers. They also wanted to make the language safe to use, fast, and have an expressive syntax.
	</p>
	<p>
		To meet these requirements, they pulled concepts from many different languages. It may be surprising to some, but Java, the language that supplied the virtual machine on which Kotlin runs, provided none to little 
		of the syntax for Kotlin. Instead, languages such as Haskell and SML have had much more of an impact on Kotlin's syntax. So much so, that 
		Android's new library for creating user interfaces is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming"  target="_blank">declarative</a>, not object oriented. This class doesn't cover 
		anything Android specific. If you want to know that library, you can study it on your own or take the mobile 
		development course after completing this and the Swift language course.
	</p>
	<h3>Python 3 and Kotlin are Cousins</h3>
	<p>Take a look at Figure 1. It shows the ancestry of both Kotlin and Python. Since an earlier version of C is an ancestor of of both C and Kotlin
       	you can expect to see some
	things in Kotlin that remind you of what you learned regarding coding when you used Python.
	A very strong contributor to Kotlin is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_(programming_language)"  target="_blank">Haskell language</a>. 
	Because of this ancestry, Kotlin has a much stronger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming"  target="_blank">functional programming</a> foundation than Python and many other languages do.
	</p>
	<p>As you learn Kotlin and if you become familiar with its ancestral languages, you will be able to pick out of the syntax and behavior influences of its ancestors.</p>

<h2>Installations</h2>
	<h3>The IDE</h3>
	<p>Regardless of the OS you are developing on, the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) selected for this course is 
	<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a>. This IDE was selected because the same company that created 
	Kotlin created this IDE. Go to the 
	<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/" target="_blank">IntelliJ</a> and download the installer the Community 
	Edition that matches your
	operating system. When you start IntelliJ you will be presented with a screen that allows you to create a new project. 
	


<h2>Test Your Tools</h2>
	Following these steps will guarantee your setup is ready to go.
	<ol>
		<li>Select "New Project" in right-hand view of the IDE.</li>
		<li>Select "Kotlin/JVM" in the right-hand sub-view.</li>
		<li>Click "Next" at the bottom of the window.</li>
		<li>Enter a name for your project at the top of the window. I use "Junk" when I know that's what it is and I can throw it away at any time without causing me pain.</li>
		<li>Right-click on the "src" directory in the left-hand panel and select "New->Kotlin class/file"</li>
		<li>In the pop-up window select "File" and enter "Main" for the name of the file.</li>
		<li>In the left hand pane, select the "Main.kt" file.</li>
		<li>Enter this in the file.<pre><code class="Kotlin">fun main(){
    println("Hello me!")
}</code></pre> 
		</li>
		<li>Click the green right-pointing triangle next to the main function.</li>
		<li>Wait for everything to compile.</li>
		<li>After the application completes, you will see "Hello me!" in the bottom window of the IDE.</li>
		<li>Add <pre><code class="Kotlin">val sum = 3+4</code></pre> before line 2.
		</li>
		<li>Click to the right of the 3 and below the green right-pointing triangle. A red dot will appear.</li>
		<li>Click the green bug in the upper right of the IDE window to debug your code.</li>
		<li>Execution stops before line 3 is executed. You will see the value of <kbd>sum</kbd> in the values window at 
		the bottom of the IDE.</li>
		<li>Above and to the left of "sum=7" find the bent arrow, the step over button.</li>
		<li>Move your mouse over and click this button on the bar between the code and the variables view.<img src="stepover.png" alt="the stepover button is a bent arrow over a bar"></li>
		<li>After you click the step over button, you will again see "Hello, me!" in the console (click "Console" to the left of the step over button).</li>
		<li>Find the "Continue" button in the left bar to run the application to the end.</li>
		<li>&#129395;</li>
	</ol>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
	<p>The work you do using this IDE will flow like this. Each time you are asked to do a task, you will create a project named for the task. For example, if you were asked for your task to write code that calculated loan payments, you could create a project called loan_pay_calc.</p>
	<p>If you follow this pattern for each assignment, you will reduce your workload. Do not create a single project 
	that holds all of your tasks. You will deeply regret that choice by the end of the class.</p>
