			<h2>Situation</h2>
		<p>
			You are working for a company that needs a technology solution to track the containers of pharmaceuticals they have in stock available for sale to pharmacies that are their customers. A UML diagram has been provided, see Figure 1 below. 
		</p>
		</section>
		<section>
		<h3>Task 1</h3>
		
		<p>
			Using classes and or structs, create a code set that appropriately uses lists, sets, and dictionaries to solve the problem. Also write driver code to execute the code you write. Attempt to add and remove many packages of many types of medication. Ensure, using stepwise debugging and debugging statements to validate that your code is behaving as the company intends.
		</p>
		<p>
			The unique identifiers for the dictionary in the design are to follow the <a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cder/ndc/dsp_searchresult.cfm">NDC</a> database's package code pattern, [5 digits]-[3 digits]-[2 digits]. You may use real codes from the database along with real information, or you may make them up.
		</p>
		<p>
			To follow good stock roll-over procedures, ensure that the containers sold are always the ones that have the nearest expiration data. The result of calling the <kbd>currentStockOf</kbd> function must also be sorted in the same order.
		</p>

		<h3>Review</h3>
		<h4>After completing the previous steps:</h4>
		<ol>
          <li>For each of the tasks, review one of the many <a href="provided_solutions.zip">possible solutions</a>,</li>
          <li>Compare and contrast your code with the possible solution's code, and</li>
          <li>Make note of any improvements you could make for future tasks.</li>
		</ol>
