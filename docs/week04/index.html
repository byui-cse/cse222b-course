	<h1>Beyond Arrays and Lists</h1>
	<p>Arrays and Lists are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things of the same type together in a specific order, 
		an array is the way to go. But for other situations Arrays are slow. For example, searching in unsorted Arrays is uses a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) algorithm in the best of situations. That's way to slow. Let's look at the two other 
		Built In Collections (BICs) Kotlin has.
	</p>
	<h2>Sets</h2>
	<p>
		Consider a situation where there can only be one copy of any piece of data in a collection. Rather than use an 
		Array or List and do a search-check each time you do an insert, way too slow, how about using the collection that is 
		designed to handle this for you, and do it much faster. The MutableSet. If you don't need to make changes, the 
		immutable <kbd>Set</kbd> is the way to go.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are a couple of ways you can create a <kbd>MutableSet</kbd>, you can, as in the snippet below, create an empty set of 
		some specific type and then add elements to it and remove elements when you need to.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Kotlin">var names = mutableSetOf<String>()
names.add("Sally")
names.add("Jose")
names.add("Sally")//no change. Sally is already there.
names.remove("Jane")//no change. Jane isn't in there.
</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		You can also create a Set while setting its values. The snippet below shows you how to do this with three names.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Kotlin">val names = mutableSetOf<String>("Jane","Sally","Jose")
</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		It's important to remember that Sets don't guarantee ordering. That's why they can do searching, inserting, and 
		removing much faster than an Array. If you need things to stay in order, remember an Array or List is what you want.
	</p>
	<p>
		As an extra benefit for selecting Set as your collection type you get to use set operations like union, 
		partition(making subsets), and the map-filter-reduce BIFs.
	</p>
	<h2>Maps</h2>
	<p>
		Kotlin also has a MutableMap BIC and it works as you might expect based on your use of such things previously. 
		It is a key-value store. Just like with Sets, Maps do not guarantee ordering. You can also create 
		empty Maps and then add, remove, and find elements. When you do this you have to indicate the type 
		of the key and the type of the value.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Kotlin">val agesByName = mutableMapOf<String,Int>()
agesByName["Sally"] = 21
agesByName["Jose"] = 23
agesByName["Jane"] = 20
</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		If you want to, you can also create and fill or partially fill a mutable or immutable dictionary all at once.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Kotlin">val agesByName = mutableMapOf("Sally" to 21,"Jose" to 23,"Jane" to 20)
</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		There are many more methods that these and Arrays have that you can use. You should take some time and review 
		them. The <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/">Kotlin documentation</a> 
		has decent descriptions of the methods and how to use them. Go check it out. 
	</p>
	<h2>Applications of Collections</h2>
	<p>
		Let's revisit the pharmacy tracker from week 03. The model class <kbd>PharmaceuticalStockTracker</kbd> had a 
		List of <kbd>Medications</kbd> that it used to keep track of how many bottles, bags, etc. of medications 
		were in stock. It did this by having each instance of <kbd>Medication</kbd> represent a bottle, bag, of medicine stored.
	</p>
	<p>
		But there is a problem with that design. It's the amount of time it takes to find medication in the system. Ah... 
		It sounds like List was the wrong choice. If we used a Map of Lists of Medications, that would solve 
		the finding problem and still let us keep multiple bottles or bags of medication of a single type in the tracking 
		system.
	</p>

	<p>
		But what would the code for that look like? Since the system would need to start without any medication being 
		stored, we'd need to create an empty MutableDictionary. The example is in the snippet below.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Kotlin">val inStockMedications = mutableMapOf&lt;String,MutableList&lt;Medication&gt;&gt;()
</code></pre>
	</p>
	<p>
		There we go. That's it. The key is a String and the value is a List of Medications. But what would the code 
		look like when medication was purchased and needed to be added to the model? Great question. That's part of your 
		task this week.
	</p>
