    <h1>Beyond Arrays and Lists</h1>
    <p>
      Arrays and Lists are wonderful things. If you need to keep several things
      of the same type together in a specific order, an array is the way to go.
      However, for other situations, an Array is slow. For example, searching an
      unsorted Array uses a \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) algorithm in the best of
      situations. That's way too slow. Let's look at the two other Built-in
      Collections (BICs) Kotlin has.
    </p>
    <h2>Set</h2>
    <p>
      Consider a situation where there can only be one copy of any piece of data
      in a collection. Rather than use an Array or List and do a search-check
      each time you do an insert, how about using the collection that is
      designed to handle this for you, the <kbd>MutableSet</kbd>. If you don't
      need to make changes, the immutable <kbd>Set</kbd> is the way to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple of ways you can create a <kbd>MutableSet</kbd>, you
      can, as in the snippet below, create an empty set of some specific type
      and then add elements to it and remove elements when you need to.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">var names = mutableSetOf&lt;String&gt;()
names.add("Sally")
names.add("Jose")
names.add("Sally")//no change. Sally is already there.
names.remove("Jane")//no change. Jane isn't in there.</code></pre>

    <p>
      You can also create a Set while setting its values. The snippet below
      shows you how to do this with three names.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">val names = mutableSetOf&lt;String&gt;("Jane","Sally","Jose")</code></pre>

    <p>
      It's important to remember that Sets don't guarantee ordering. That's why
      they can do searching, inserting, and removing much faster than an Array.
      If you need the elements to stay in order, an Array or List is what you
      want.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an extra benefit for selecting <kbd>Set</kbd> as your collection type,
      you get to use set operations like union, partition (making subsets), and
      the map-filter-reduce BIFs.
    </p>
    <h2>Map</h2>
    <p>
      Kotlin also has a MutableMap BIC and it works as you might expect. It is a
      key-value store. Just like with Sets, Maps do not guarantee ordering. You
      can also create empty Maps and then add, remove, and find elements. When
      you do this you have to indicate the type of the key and the type of the
      value.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">val agesByName = mutableMapOf&lt;String,Int&gt;()
agesByName["Sally"] = 21
agesByName["Jose"] = 23
agesByName["Jane"] = 20</code></pre>
    <p>
      If you want to, you can also create and fill or partially fill a mutable
      or immutable dictionary all at once.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">val agesByName = mutableMapOf("Sally" to 21,"Jose" to 23,"Jane" to 20)</code></pre>
    <p>
      There are many more methods that these colletions and Arrays/Lists have
      that you can use. Take some time and review them. The
      <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/api/latest/jvm/stdlib/kotlin.collections/"
        >Kotlin documentation</a
      >
      has decent descriptions of the methods and how to use them.
    </p>
    <h2>Applications of Collections</h2>
    <p>
      Let's revisit the pharmacy tracker from Week 3. The model class
      <kbd>PharmaceuticalStockTracker</kbd> had a List of
      <kbd>Medications</kbd> that is used to keep track of how many bottles,
      bags, etc. of medications are in stock. It did this by having each
      instance of <kbd>Medication</kbd> represent a bottle, bag, etc. of
      medicine stored.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is a problem with that design. The amount of time it takes to
      find medication in the system is far too long. It seems like List was the
      wrong choice. If we used a Map of Lists of Medications, that would solve
      the finding problem and still let us keep multiple bottles or bags of
      medication of a single type in the tracking system.
    </p>

    <p>
      But what would the code for that look like? Since the system would need to
      start without any medication being stored, we'd need to create an empty
      MutableDictionary. The example is in the snippet below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">val inStockMedications = mutableMapOf&lt;String,MutableList&lt;Medication&gt;&gt;()</code></pre>
    <p>
      There we go. That's it. The key is a String and the value is a List of
      Medications. But what would the code look like when medication was
      purchased and needed to be added to the model? Great question. That's part
      of your task this week.
    </p>
