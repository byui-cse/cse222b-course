      <h1>Week 3 Task Instructions</h1>
      <section>
        <h3>Before beginning this Assignment:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Make sure you have read and understood the
            <a href="index.html" target="_blank">reading for the week</a>.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>
          Like last week, please download the
          <a download href="task-project/src/main/kotlin/tasks.kt">tasks.kt</a>
          and
          <a download href="task-project/src/main/kotlin/main.kt">main.kt</a>
          files for this week's assignment and create a Kotlin project that
          contains these two files. You should not modify main.kt in any way.
          Your tasks are in comments in tasks.kt. Each time you successfully
          compile and run, the test functions in main.kt will test your progress
          and report which tasks are successfully completed, which are currently
          failing on all of the tests.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your goal is to write code in tasks.kt so that all tasks are passing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The first task this week includes implementing the data structures in
          this UML diagram.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="images/W3UML2.png"
            alt="An image showing each of the classes: MedicationContainer, Liquid Medication Container, Tablet Medication Container, and the struct Pharmaceutical Stock Tracker, their properties, and the relationships between them"
          />
          <figcaption>
            Fig.1 - A UML Class and Struct Diagram for the MedicationContainer,
            LiquidMedicationContainer, TabletMedicationContainer, and
            PharmaceuticalStockTracker classes.
          </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
          This is similar to, but not identical to the UML diagram in the
          reading this week. Since the test code refers to these classes and
          struct, the project will not initially compile until you have
          implemented the necessary data structures.
        </p>

        <p>
          When all tasks are passing, submit your work in the Canvas system. You
          should submit two files: your copy of tasks.kt and a screenshot
          showing successful execution.
