	<h1>\(\lambda\) Functions and Closures</h1>
	<p>
		\(\lambda\) functions are a mathematical construct that computer science and computation in general 
		has borrowed. You've used them before in your Python courses. You've also used them in Swift as closures 
		when you did the <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, and <kbd>reduce</kbd> tasks. Now let's learn some more 
		about them.
    </p>
	<h3>Storing Closures in Variables and Data Collections</h3>
	<p>
		Due to its functional programming ancestor Haskell, Swift's functions can be stored in variables and can also 
		be passed around as parameters to other functions and methods. (From this point on, we'll use the word function 
		to mean both stand-alone functions and methods.) Generalization is a common pattern that you've 
		followed before whenever you created a function. You had a series of computations that could be applied to 
		various data values. Using stored closures allows your functions to be generalized even further. It also allows 
		more of your code to be reused so defects are found and fixed more readily.
	</p>
	<p>
		But how does storing a closure make greater generalization possible? When you store closures in a data structure 
		you can retrieve the right one for any given situation and use it within a function, you are replacing some of the fixed computational steps with some that are dependent on the situation. Consider this example.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine you are creating a web service of some kind. Each time a request comes in from a web browser there is 
		some sort of a command (login, logout, update something, download something, display something, etc.) and some 
		data that goes along with the command (username and password, the name of the file to download, the data from 
		the file to store on the server, etc.). You could write a function with a huge <kbd>if-else if-else</kbd> clause 
		where each branch of the <kbd>if-else if-else</kbd> clause checks the command and executes code inside the 
		scope of the correct branch to deal with the data sent. This naive design has many problems and would look 
		something like the code below.
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Swift">func handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataDictionary){

	if aCommand == "login"{
		//login handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "logout"{
		//logout handling code here
	}
	else if aCommand == "upload"{
		//file upload handling code here
	}
	/*
	 * and another, and another, and another, and another,....
	 */
	else{
		//unrecognized command handling code here
	}
}</code></pre></p>
	<p>
		What kinds of problems might this cause? Well, first there is the duplication of code all over the place. You 
		might not yet realize it, but there are some web services with hundreds of different commands. Do you really 
		want to type <kbd>else if aCommand ==</kbd> that many times? How long can you read through a list of those 
		without your brain getting numb? Stepwise debugging such a mess can also be a problem. 
	</p>
	<p>
		But there is even a bigger problem. What order are you going to do the checks in? String comparison is an 
		expensive computation to perform in any language so you should put the most commonly used commands first. 
		But which command is that? Oh...by the way, the most commonly used command will change over time. 
	</p>
	<p>
		What, then, can be done? Well, first of all, in web services you usually do the same thing each time a 
		command-data pairing is received. 
		First you have to make sure the command is a valid command. Hackers will send random commands to see if they 
		can get your service to send them back a failure message. You'd better be validating the command.
	</p>
	<p>
		You also have to validate the data. Once they figure out a valid command, these same hackers will send invalid 
		data to try to crash your service so they can take over your system by performing a code injection  or 
		some other type of attack.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once you've validated both of these things, your web service will usually interact with a database. This 
		could be by getting data from the database, putting data in the database, or both and then finally, your service will put together some data to send back to the client.
	</p>
	<p>
		So these steps are performed over, and over, and over. At major web sites these steps are performed millions of 
		times a minute. The naive <kbd>if-else if-else</kbd> design isn't going to be good enough. You'll have to 
		duplicate this validation, access, response pattern for each command. How then can this be made better? After 
		all, each command has to be dealt with in a specific way. The solution to this lies in 
		using a Dictionary and the principle that functions and closures are 
		<a href="https://lispcast.com/what-are-first-class-functions/">first class citizens</a> in Swift.
	</p>
	<p>
		 Consider this. Imagine you had a Dictionary where the key was the command and the value for that key was a 
		 closure. Let's call this type <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>. Here are a couple of type aliases to make it 
		 easier to read code later on. After all, you don't want to keep typing stuff you don't have too, right? :)
	</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Swift">//some aliases to make the code easier to read
typealias DataDictionary = Dictionary&lt;String,Any&gt;
typealias CommandDictionary = Dictionary&lt;String,(DataDictionary)->DataDictionary?&gt;
</code></pre></p>
<p>
	Now each time you need a <kbd>Dictionary</kbd> that has a <kbd>String</kbd> as a key and anything at all as 
	the value, you can use the custom type <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> instead of typing 
	<kbd>Dictionary&lt;String,Any&gt;</kbd> over and over. The <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd> type alias uses <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> right away. Each <kbd>CommandDictionary</kbd>, as you see above, has <kbd>Strings</kbd> 
	for keys and functions or closures as values. Each of these functions or closures has a <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> 
	as a parameter and a <kbd>DataDictionary</kbd> optional as its value. This way, each of the command functions in 
	the dictionary can receive data in the form of a dictionary, do its job, and then return either the same dictionary 
	it was passed or modify it and return the modified dictionary. You'll see how this fits together below. 
</p>
<p>
	So let's see what can be done with command and data dictionaries. If you created three command dictionaries, one 
	to hold validation functions, a second to hold interaction functions, and a third to hold response generation 
	functions, you could completely get rid of the <kbd>if-else if-else</kbd> clause from the <kbd>handlRequest</kbd> 
	function above and create a variation of the 
	<a href="https://www.javaguides.net/2018/08/application-controller-design-pattern-in-java.html">Application 
	Controller Pattern</a>.
</p>
<p>
	For this example, each command is mapped to one validation function to check to make sure the incoming data is 
	formatted correctly and doesn't have any hacking attempts going on inside the data itself. Each command is 
	also mapped to one interaction function. This function does any database access and/or updates and data 
	calculations needed. Finally, each command is mapped to a response generation function where the data is 
	packaged correctly for what ever client made the request be it a mobile app, a web browser, or an application.
</p>
<p>
	That means that all <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> needs to do is get each of these functions from the three 
	<kbd>CommandDictionaries</kbd>, apply them in the industry standard order, and deal with any failures when the 
	functions from the dictionaries are applied. The code below, you'll need to scroll to see the whole thing, 
	shows how to do this along with the documentation for the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function. Notice how the 
	functions are retrieved from the dictionaries and put in a variable and then the variable is used to call the 
	function.
</p>
	<p><pre><code class="Swift">///
///A facade function that executes any and all functions for any given command
///and passes each function the data associated with the command.
///If validation fails, no interaction or response generation function is called. If the interaction function 
///fails, no response generation function is called. This enforces 'validation first' as a design principle.
///Parameters:  aCommand - a String that is the command read from the web request
///             theData - a DataDictionary that is any data sent as part of the web request
///             theValidationFunctions - a CommandDictionary that holds all validation functions for all commands
///             theInteractionFunctions - a CommandDictionary that holds all the interaction functions for all commands
///             theResponseFunctions - a CommandDictionary that holds all the response-building functions for all commands
///Returns: the a DataDictionary indicating how far through the request handling process was achieved and true if
///             the request succeeded. False otherwise.
///Complexity: O(1) plus the sum of the complexities of the validation, interaction,
///            and response functions for any given command
func handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataDictionary, theValidationFunctions:CommandDictionary, theInteractionFunctions:CommandDictionary, theResponseFunctions:CommandDictionary) ->(Bool,DataDictionary?) {
    
    //if all three functions exist the command is an expected command
    guard let aValidationFunction = theValidationFunctions[aCommand],
          let anInteractionFunction = theInteractionFunctions[aCommand],
          let aResponseFunction = theResponseFunctions[aCommand]
    else {
        return (false,theData)
    }
    // if successfully found functions, do what ever validation is needed
    guard let theValidationData = aValidationFunction(theData)  else {
        return (false,theData)
    }
    //if successfully validated, do what ever interaction is needed
    guard let theInteractionData = anInteractionFunction(theValidationData)  
    else {
        return (false,theValidationData)
    }
    //if successfully completed interaction, put together a response
    guard let theResponseData = aResponseFunction(theInteractionData)  
    else {
        return (false,theInteractionData)
    }
    return (true,theResponseData)
}</code>
	</pre></p>
	<p>
	This function enforces security for your web service. Nothing can be executed until it passes validation. Also, when 
	your boss come to you and says, "Can you get it to do this too?" Your answer can be yes! All you need to do is add 
	three functions to the dictionaries! No more wasted time trying to find the appropriate place in the 
	<kbd>if-else if-else</kbd> clause and no more duplicating code. Storing functions and closures in variables and 
	data collections is a very powerful technique. As you get more and more comfortable with it you'll see more and 
	more ways to make your code more abstract, and therefore more powerful. :)
	</p>
	<h3>Passing Functions or Closures as Parameters</h3>
	<p>
		You've used functions that had other functions as parameters. The <kbd>map, filter,</kbd> and <kbd>reduce</kbd> 
		functions last week leveraged this concept heavily. But you are not limited to being able to do this with 
		BIF's. You can write your own functions that do this too.
	</p>
	<p>
		Any time you want to make your functions more abstract and therefore more powerful, you can pass part of the 
		behavior of the function as a parameter. If you think about it, the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function above 
		does this. It just passes collections of functions or closures instead of one.
	</p>
	<p>
		Having a function or closure as a parameter allows a programmer to decide later, long after you've written 
		your function, what some of the behavior of your function should be. That way your function can be 
		reused and there will be less code duplication in the application.
	</p>
	<p>
		Imagine how horrible it would be to have to write a loop to filter each of the 10,000 different data sets that 
		would be the result of doing 10,000 different database requests. Ouch! No fun at all. Thankfully someone 
		wrote the filter BIF for us to use instead. Be that person. Write abstract, flexible code.  
	</p>
	<p>
		What, then, does the method signature of a function that accepts a function or closure look like? I'm going to 
		give you a silly example below so you can focus on the principle. I'd never actually write this function for an 
		application. Instead I'd use the <kbd>reduce</kbd> BIF.
	</p>

	<p><pre><code class="Swift">func doIntegerMath(integers:[Int], initialValue:Int, mathToDo:(Int, Int)->Int) -> Int {
    var accumulator = initialValue
    for integer in integers {
        accumulator = mathToDo(accumulator,integer)
    }
    return accumulator
}</code></pre></p>
	<p>
		In the snippet, the <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter is a function or closure that has two integer parameters and 
		has an integer as it's value. The <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter's type declaration ends at the <kbd>)</kbd> 
		character that concludes the list of parameters for the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function. The <kbd>-> Int</kbd> 
		characters after that indicate the value of the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function.
	</p>
	<p>
		Notice how similar <kbd>mathToDo</kbd>'s type declaration is to a regular function definition. If it were a 
		function declaration, the only thing that would be missing would be the names of the parameters. Please don't put 
		parameter names in closure type declarations. They will cause compiler errors. 
	</p>
