    <h1>Using and Creating \(\lambda\) Functions</h1>
    <p>
      \(\lambda\) functions are a mathematical construct that computer science
      and computation in general has borrowed. You've used them before in your
      Python courses. You've also used them in Kotlin when you used the
      <kbd>map</kbd>, <kbd>filter</kbd>, <kbd>reduce</kbd>, and
      <kbd>sort</kbd> higher order functions. Now let's learn some more about
      them and how to use them.
    </p>
    <h3>Storing Lambdas in Variables and Data Collections</h3>
    <p>
      Due to its functional programming ancestor Haskell, Kotlin's functions can
      be stored in variables and can also be passed around as parameters to
      other functions and methods. (From this point on, we'll use the word
      function to mean both stand-alone functions and methods.) Generalization
      is a common pattern that you've followed before whenever you created a
      function. You had a series of computations that could be applied to
      various data values. Using stored lambdas allows your functions to be
      generalized even further. It also allows more of your code to be reused so
      defects are found and fixed more readily.
    </p>
    <p>
      But how does storing a closure make greater generalization possible? When
      you store lambdas in a data structure you can retrieve the right one for
      any given situation and use it within a function, you are replacing some
      of the fixed computational steps with some that are dependent on the
      situation. Consider the following example.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine you are creating a web service of some kind. Each time a request
      comes in from a web browser there is some sort of a command (login,
      logout, update something, download something, display something, etc.) and
      some data that goes along with the command (username and password, the
      name of the file to download, the data from the file to store on the
      server, etc.). You could write a function with a huge
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause where each branch of the
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause checks the command and executes code inside the
      scope of the correct branch to deal with the data sent. This naive design
      has many problems and would look something like the code below.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">fun handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:Map&lt;String,Object&gt;){

    if (aCommand == "login"){
        //login handling code here
    }
    else if (aCommand == "logout"){
        //logout handling code here
    }
    else if (aCommand == "upload"){
        //file upload handling code here
    }
    /*
     * and another, and another, and another, and another,....
     */
    else{
        //unrecognized command handling code here
    }
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      What kinds of problems might this cause? Well, first there is the
      duplication of code all over the place. You might not yet realize it, but
      there are some web services with hundreds of different commands. Do you
      really want to type <kbd>else if aCommand ==</kbd> that many times? How
      long can you read through a list of those without your brain getting numb?
      Stepwise debugging such a mess can also be a problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there is even a bigger problem. What order are you going to do the
      checks in? String comparison is an expensive computation to perform in any
      language so you should put the most commonly used commands first. But
      which command is that? The most commonly used command will change over
      time, so you need to make sure to always check what your users are doing.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, can be done? Well, first of all, in web services you usually
      do the same thing each time a command-data pairing is received. First you
      have to make sure the command is a valid command. Hackers will send random
      commands to see if they can get your service to send them back a failure
      message. You'd better be validating the command.
    </p>
    <p>
      You also need validate the data. Once they figure out a valid command,
      these same hackers will send invalid data to try to crash your service so
      they can take over your system by performing a code injection or some
      other type of attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've validated both the command and the data, your web service will
      usually interact with a database. This could be by getting data from the
      database, putting data in the database, or both. Then your service will
      put together some data to send back to the client.
    </p>
    <p>
      These steps are performed over and over. At major web sites these steps
      are performed millions of times a minute. The naive
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> design isn't going to be good enough. You'll have to
      duplicate this validation, access, response pattern for each command. How
      then can this be made better? After all, each command must be dealt with
      in a specific way. The solution to this lies in using a Map and the
      principle that functions and lambdas are
      <a href="https://lispcast.com/what-are-first-class-functions/"
        >first class citizens</a
      >
      in Kotlin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consider this. Imagine you had a Map where the key was the command and the
      value for that key was a closure. Let's call this type
      <kbd>CommandMap</kbd> and have it be immutable. Here are a couple of
      <kbd>typealiases</kbd> to make it easier to read code later on. After all,
      you don't want to keep typing stuff you don't have too, right? &#128521;
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">//some aliases to make the code easier to read
typealias DataMap = HashMap&lt;String, Any&gt;
typealias CommandMap = HashMap&lt;String, (DataMap)->DataMap?&gt;
</code></pre>
    <p>
      Now each time you need a <kbd>Map</kbd> that has a <kbd>String</kbd> as a
      key and anything at all as the value, you can use the custom type
      <kbd>DataMap</kbd> instead of typing <kbd>Map&lt;String,Any&gt;</kbd> over
      and over. The <kbd>CommandMap</kbd> <kbd>typealias</kbd> uses
      <kbd>DataMap</kbd> right away. Each <kbd>CommandMap</kbd>, as you see
      above, has a <kbd>String</kbd> as the key and a function or lambda as the
      value. Each of these functions or lambdas has a <kbd>DataMap</kbd> as a
      parameter and a <kbd>DataMap</kbd> optional as its value. This way, each
      of the command functions in the dictionary can receive data in the form of
      a dictionary, do its job, and then return either the same dictionary it
      was passed or modify it and return the modified dictionary. You'll see how
      this fits together below.
    </p>
    <p>
      So let's see what can be done with command and data dictionaries. If you
      created three command dictionaries, one to hold validation functions, a
      second to hold interaction functions, and a third to hold response
      generation functions, you could completely get rid of the
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause from the <kbd>handlRequest</kbd>
      function above and create a variation of the
      <a
        href="https://www.javaguides.net/2018/08/application-controller-design-pattern-in-java.html"
        >Application Controller Pattern</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this example, each command is mapped to one validation function to
      check to make sure the incoming data is formatted correctly and doesn't
      have any hacking attempts going on inside the data itself. Each command is
      also mapped to one interaction function. This function does any database
      access and/or updates and data calculations needed. Finally, each command
      is mapped to a response generation function where the data is packaged
      correctly for whichever client made the request. It could be a mobile app,
      a web browser, or an application.
    </p>
    <p>
      This means that all <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> needs to do is get each of
      these functions from the three <kbd>CommandMaps</kbd>, apply them in the
      industry standard order, and deal with any failures when the functions
      from the dictionaries are applied. The code below, you'll need to scroll
      to see the whole thing, shows how to do this along with the documentation
      for the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function. Notice how the functions are
      retrieved from the dictionaries and put in a variable and then the
      variable is used to call the function.
    </p>
    <pre><code class="Kotlin">///
///A facade function that executes any and all functions for any given command
///and passes each function the data associated with the command.
///If validation fails, no interaction or response generation function is called. If the interaction function 
///fails, no response generation function is called. This enforces 'validation first' as a design principle.
///Parameters:  aCommand - a String that is the command read from the web request
///             theData - a DataMap that is any data sent as part of the web request
///             theValidationFunctions - a CommandMap that holds all validation functions for all commands
///             theInteractionFunctions - a CommandMap that holds all the interaction functions for all commands
///             theResponseFunctions - a CommandMap that holds all the response-building functions for all commands
///Returns: the a DataMap indicating how far through the request handling process was achieved and true if
///             the request succeeded. False otherwise.
///Complexity: O(1) plus the sum of the complexities of the validation, interaction,
///            and response functions for any given command
fun handleRequest(aCommand:String, theData:DataMap, theValidationFunctions:CommandMap, theInteractionFunctions:CommandMap, theResponseFunctions:CommandMap) : Pair&lt;Boolean,DataMap?&gt; {

    //if all three functions exist the command is an expected command
    val aValidationFunction = theValidationFunctions[aCommand] ?: return Pair(false,null)
    val anInteractionFunction = theInteractionFunctions[aCommand] ?: return Pair(false,null)
    val aResponseFunction = theResponseFunctions[aCommand] ?: return Pair(false,null)

    // if successfully found functions, do what ever validation is needed
    val theValidationData = aValidationFunction(theData) ?: return Pair(false,null)

    //if successfully validated, do what ever interaction is needed
    val theInteractionData = anInteractionFunction(theValidationData) ?: return Pair(false,null)

    //if successfully completed interaction, put together a response
    val theResponseData = aResponseFunction(theInteractionData) ?: return Pair(false,null)
    
    return Pair(true,theResponseData)
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      This function enforces security for your web service. Nothing can be
      executed until it passes validation. Also, when your boss comes to you and
      says, "Can you get it to do this too?" Your answer can be yes! All you
      need to do is add three functions to the dictionaries! No more wasted time
      trying to find the appropriate place in the
      <kbd>if-else</kbd> clause and no more duplicating code. Storing functions
      and lambdas in variables and data collections is a very powerful
      technique. As you get more and more comfortable with it you'll see more
      and more ways to make your code more abstract, and therefore more
      powerful.
    </p>
    <h3>Passing Functions or lambdas as Parameters</h3>
    <p>
      You've already used functions that had other functions as parameters. The
      <kbd>map, filter,</kbd> and <kbd>reduce</kbd>
      functions last week leveraged this concept heavily. But you are not
      limited to being able to do this with BIF's. You can write your own
      functions that do this too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any time you want to make your functions more abstract and therefore more
      powerful, you can pass part of the behavior of the function as a
      parameter. If you think about it, the <kbd>handleRequest</kbd> function
      above does this. It just passes collections of functions or lambdas
      instead of one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having a function as a parameter allows a programmer to decide later, long
      after you've written your function, what some of the behavior of your
      function should be. That way your function can be reused and there will be
      less code duplication in the application.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine how horrible it would be to have to write a loop to filter each of
      the 10,000 different data sets that would be the result of doing 10,000
      different database requests. Ouch! No fun at all. Thankfully someone wrote
      the filter BIF for us to use instead. Be that person. Write abstract,
      flexible code.
    </p>
    <p>
      What, then, does the method signature of a function that accepts a
      function look like? Here is an example that illustrates the principle. In
      a real application, you should use the
      <kbd>reduce</kbd> BIF, but this example is an interesting look at how you
      could use a closure as a parameter.
    </p>

    <pre><code class="Kotlin">fun doIntegerMath(integers:Array&lt;Int&gt;, initialValue:Int, mathToDo:(Int, Int)->Int) : Int {
    var accumulator = initialValue
    for (integer in integers) {
        accumulator = mathToDo(accumulator,integer)
    }
    return accumulator
}</code></pre>
    <p>
      In the snippet, the <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter is a function that has
      two integer parameters and has an integer as it's value. The
      <kbd>mathToDo</kbd> parameter's type declaration ends at the
      <kbd>)</kbd> character that concludes the list of parameters for the
      <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function. The <kbd>: Int</kbd> characters after
      that indicate the value of the <kbd>doIntegerMath</kbd> function.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice how similar <kbd>mathToDo</kbd>'s type declaration is to a regular
      function definition. If it were a function declaration, the only thing
      that would be missing would be the names of the parameters. Please don't
      put parameter names in closure type declarations. They will cause compiler
      errors.
    </p>
